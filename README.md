# SubroutineTest

SubroitineTest is Abaqus 6.14 plugin intended for user-defined constitutive model assessment automation. As such, its planned purpose is to allow to pre-configure and autogenerate simple dynamic/explicit models for user-defined VUHARD subroutines.

## Formalities

The plugin is part of my Master's Thesis "Assessment of material models describing behaviour of metals under high strain rate deformation conditions". As such, no third-party contributions to this project may be accepted until the day of my thesis' defence. However, feel free to fork and/or use the plugin, as long as you find it worth using.
